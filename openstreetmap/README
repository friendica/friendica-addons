This addon allows you to use OpenStreetMap for displaying locations.

___ Requirements ___

To use this plugin you need a tile Server that provides the maps.
OpenStreetMap data is free for everyone to use. Their tile servers are not.
Please take a look at their "Tile Usage Policy":
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_usage_policy
You can run your own tile server or choose one from their list of public
tile servers: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TMS
Support the OpenStreetMap community and share the load.

___ Configuration ___

Activate the plugin from your admin panel.  

You can now add a Tile Server and default zoom level in the plugin settings
page of your admin panel.

The Time Server URL points to the tile server you want to use. Use the full URL,
with protocol (http/s) and trailing slash. You can configure the default zoom
level on the map in the Default Zoom box.  1 will show the whole world and 18 is the highest
zoom level available.
