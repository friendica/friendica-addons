 ____ OpenStreetMap Plugin ____

This addon allows you to use OpenStreetMap for displaying locations.

___ Requirements ___

To use this plugin you need a tile Server that provides the maps.
OpenStreetMap data is free for everyone to use. Their tile servers are not.
Please take a look at their "Tile Usage Policy":
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_usage_policy
You can run your own tile server or choose one from their list of public
tile servers: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TMS
Support the OpenStreetMap community and share the load.

___ Configuration ___

Open the .htconfig.php file and add "openstreetmap" to the list of activated
addons.
    $a->config['system']['addon'] = "openstreetmap, ..."

You have to add two configuration variables for the addon:
    $a->config['openstreetmap']['tmsserver'] = 'http://www.openstreetmap.org/';
    $a->config['openstreetmap']['zoom'] = '18';

The *tmsserver* points to the tile server you want to use. Use the full URL,
with protocol (http/s) and trailing slash. You can configure the default zoom
level on the map with *zoom*. 1 will show the whole world and 18 is the highest
zoom level available.
