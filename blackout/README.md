About
-----

This plugin will allow you to enter a date/time period during which
all your ~friendica visitors from the web will be redirected to a page
you can configure in the admin panel as well.

Calls to the API and the communication with other ~friendica nodes is
not effected from this plugin.

If you enter a period the current date would be affected none of the
currently logged in users will be effected as well. But if they log
out they can't login again. That way you dear admin can double check
the entered time periode and fix typos without having to hack the
database directly.

Requirements
