#### Installing the Friendica/Facebook connector

Please register a Facebook application at [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/async/create/platform-setup/dialog/)

Chose "Website" as platform. Next you have to let your application be reviewed. You need these permissions for that:

publish_actions, publish_pages, user_posts, user_photos, user_status, user_videos, manage_pages

After your application was reviewed, your users can post to Facebook.
