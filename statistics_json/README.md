With this addon you send some information about your friendica node to the
[the-federation.info](http://the-federation.info) page. It collects
statistical data about building blocks of *The Federation*, the decentralized
federated social networks (Diaspora*, ~friendica and red#matrix).

The information includes

* the name of your node
* friendica version
* registration policy
* total number of users of that node and the active user number
* total number of public postings
* which plugins are activated (only Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Wordpress
  will be displayed on the statistics page at the moment).
