Need to check:

endpoint in [amazon, custom]
signature in [v2, v4]
path style in [true, false]
    upload
    download
    presigned URL generation
    presigned URL access


USING VIRTUAL HOSTING, v4 SIGNATURES
    presigned URL must use s3.amazonaws.com i.e. path-style hosting (because who needs logic?)
