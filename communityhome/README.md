Community Home
--------------

This addon overwrites the default home page shown to anonymous users.
On the sidebar there are the login form, last ten users (if they chose
to be in the site directory), last ten public photos and last ten
"likes" sent by a site user or about a site user's item.

In the main content is shown the community stream. This addon doesn't
honor your community page visibility site setting: the community
stream is shown also if you have choose to not show the community page.

If 'home.html' is found in your friendica root, its content is inserted
before community stream

By default no features are enabled, you can edit this addon's settings
through the admin panel.
