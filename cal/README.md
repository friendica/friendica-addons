Calendar Export
===============

This addon makes it possible to export the events posted by your users, 
so they can be imported into other calendar applications.

Exporting a calendar is an _opt-in_ feature which has to be activated by each
of the users in the _addon settings_. As the admin you can only provide the
service but should not force it upon your users.

The calendars are exported at

	http://example.com/cal/username/export/format

currently the following formats are supported

* ical
* csv.
