Installing the Friendica/Facebook connector

1. Visit https://developers.facebook.com/apps to register an app.
    a) Click "Create a new app"
    b) We'd be very happy if you include "Friendica" in the application name
       to increase name recognition.  
    c) Edit your app settings on the setup page.  The Friendica icons are present
       in the images directory and may be uploaded as a Facebook app icon.  Use 
       images/friendica-16.jpg for the Icon and images/Friendica-128.jpg for the logo.
    d) In the App Display name enter the name of your app (this should default to the
       name you chose in part a).
    e) Enter YourDomain.com in the App Domain field and hit return.
    f) In "Select how your app connects with Facebook select "Website" and enter the 
       full URL to your Friendica install including HTTPS and a trailing slash.

2.    Enable the Facebook plugin by clicking on the icon next to it's name on the plugin
      page of your admin panel.
   b) return to the Facebook plugin page in your admin panel, and fill in the App-ID
      and Application Secret settings you got from Facebook.
   c) Click save.
   d) Finally, return to the Facebook settings page, and activate real-time updates.

	i. If you for any reason prefer to use a configuration file instead of the admin panels, 
	    Activate the plugin by including it in .htconfig.php, e.g.
	    
		$a->config['system']['addon'] = 'plugin1,plugin2,facebook';
	
	    and set the following values:
		$a->config['facebook']['appid'] = 'xxxxxxxxxxx';
		$a->config['facebook']['appsecret'] = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';

	    Replace with the settings Facebook gives you.
	

3.    To use the Facebook plugin, visit the "connector settings" area of your settings
      page.  Click "Install Facebook Connector".  
4.    This will ask you to login to Facebook and allow the plugin to do it's stuff.  
      Allow it to do so.
5.    You're done. To turn it off visit the Plugin Settings page again and
      'Remove Facebook posting'.

Vidoes and embeds will not be posted if there is no other content. Links 
and images will be converted to a format suitable for the Facebook API and 
long posts truncated - with a link to view the full post. 

Facebook contacts will not be able to view private photos, as they are not able to
authenticate to your site to establish identity. We will address this 
in a future release.
