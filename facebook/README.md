Installing the Friendica/Facebook connector

Detailed instructions how to use this plugin can be found at
the [How to: Friendica's Facebook Connector](https://github.com/friendica/friendica/wiki/How-to:-Friendica%E2%80%99s-Facebook-connector) page.

Vidoes and embeds will not be posted if there is no other content. Links 
and images will be converted to a format suitable for the Facebook API and 
long posts truncated - with a link to view the full post. 

Facebook contacts will not be able to view private photos, as they are not able to
authenticate to your site to establish identity. We will address this 
in a future release.

Info: please make sure that you understand all aspects due to Friendica's 
default licence which is: [MIT License](https://github.com/friendica/friendica/blob/master/LICENSE)
