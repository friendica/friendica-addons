About
  This plugin adds an Impressum block to the /friendica page with informations
  about the page operator/owner and how to contact you in case of any questions.

  In the notes and postal fields you can use HTML tags for formatting.

Configuration:
  Simply fill in the fields in the impressium settings page in the plugins area
  of your admin panel.
 
If you for any reason prefer to use a configuration file instead, you can set the 
following variables in the .htconfig file

  * $a->config['impressum']['owner']           this is the Name of the Operator
  * $a->config['impressum']['ownerprofile']    this is an optional Friendica account

  * $a->config['impressum']['email']           a contact email address (optional)
                                               will be displayed slightly obfuscated
                                               as name(at)example(dot)com

  * $a->config['impressum']['postal']          should contain a postal address where
                                               you can be reached at (optional)
  * $a->config['impressum']['notes']           additional informations that should
