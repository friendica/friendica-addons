App.net Plugin
==============

With this addon to friendica you can give your users the possibility to post their *public* messages to App.net and 
to import their timeline. The messages will be strapped their rich context and shortened to 256 characters length if 
necessary.

Installation
------------

If you have an developer account you can create an Application for all of your users at 
[https://account.app.net/developer/apps/](https://account.app.net/developer/apps/). Add the redirect uri 
"https://your.server.name/appnet/connect" (Replace "your.server.name" with the hostname of your server)

If you can't create an application (because you only have a free account) this addon still works, but your users have to create individual applications on their own.
