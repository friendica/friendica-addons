Default Features Plugin

This plugin allows the site admin to choose which Additional Features
 are on by default for newly created users on the site. The defaults 
 apply to all new users upon registration, but do not impact a user's
 ability to turn features on/off once their account has been created.
These default settings do not impact existing users.
