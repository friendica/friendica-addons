# URL replace

This addon will replace all occurrences of specified URLs with the address of
alternative servers in all displayed postings on a Friendica node.

You can use this to switch from Twitter (or X) to a nitter instance, from
YouTube to an invidious instance, or from some news sites to 12ft.io.

Note: If you are using the twitter connector on your server, the links to the
contacts profile pages will not be replaced by this addon. Only links in the
body of the postings are affected.

## Why

- Access a website without JavaScript enabled to prevent JavaScript analytics
  and potential IP-based tracking
- Avoid seeing ads on YouTube videos
