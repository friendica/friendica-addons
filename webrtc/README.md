WebRTC Plugin
=============

This is a quick and dirty addon to add a [webrtc][1] website as an app. As webrtc
advances so rapidly there is s a chance this plugin will be obsolete. Webrtc is
a new video and audio conferencing tool that is browser to browser
communication, no need to download specific software for just conferencing.
There are many different webrtc instances and because of the technology it is
really a person 2 person communication, using the server to only signal who
wants to talk to who, the actual transfer of the audio and video is directly
between the participants.

If you would like to try this plugin please download one of the following
either Chrome/Chromium 25 or higher or Firefox 21 or higher. Then test it by
visiting a known webrtc instance (i.e. [live.mayfirst.org](https://live.mayfirst.org)) create a
room, you should be asked to share your camera and microphone (firefox will let
you choose one or the other, whereas chrome/chromium asks for both in one
question).

If the test is successful then proceed with copying the webrtc instance you
would like to use and place it in the config window and save. Now when you
open the app it will load the webrtc instance for you to use.
