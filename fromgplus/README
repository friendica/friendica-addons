This extension fetches messages from a Google+ account and reshares it.

You have to place the following config values in your .htconfig.php:

$a->config['fromgplus']['key'] = "your key";
$a->config['fromgplus']['poll_interval'] = 10;

You need an API key for "Simple API Access". 

- You go to https://code.google.com/apis/console/
- Then you go to "Services" and activate "Google+ API".
- After that you go to "API Access".
- At the bottom of the page you see "Simple API Access".

The value after "API key:" is the key that you need.
