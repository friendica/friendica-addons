"collapses any content containing those keywords so it is not displayed at "
"inappropriate times, such as sexual innuendo that may be improper in a work "
"setting. It is polite and recommended to tag any content containing nudity "
"with #NSFW.  This filter can also match any other word/text you specify, and "
